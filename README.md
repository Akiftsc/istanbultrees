# IstanbulTrees

This is where you can find monumental trees along Istanbul. I've inspired from [Mert Bulan's Trees: Hamburg Mobile App](https://mertbulan.com/work/trees-hamburg) This projects uses Leaflet JS, and pure React with Vite.
All the data has been provided by [Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's monumental tree project's](https://anitagac.istanbul/) rest API.
